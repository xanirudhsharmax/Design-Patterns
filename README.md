Design Pattern

What Are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They provide reusable templates for structuring code in a way that improves maintainability, scalability, and efficiency.

They are not code snippets, but rather best practices and guidelines for solving problems that frequently occur in software development.

Why Use Design Patterns?
Code Reusability – Patterns provide a standard way to solve problems, reducing redundant work.
Maintainability – Well-structured code is easier to understand, modify, and extend.
Scalability – Patterns help in designing software that can adapt to changes and growth.
Improved Communication – Developers can discuss solutions using pattern names (e.g., "Let's use the Factory Pattern"), improving collaboration.
Avoiding Anti-Patterns – They help prevent bad coding practices that lead to spaghetti code or inefficiencies.
Design patterns are categorized into three main types:

Creational Patterns – Focus on object creation mechanisms.

🏗 Singleton – Ensures only one instance of a class exists.
🏭 Factory Method – Creates objects without specifying their exact class.
🔧 Builder – Simplifies complex object creation.
Structural Patterns – Focus on class and object composition.

🏗 Adapter – Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
🎭 Facade – Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
📦 Decorator – Dynamically adds behaviors to objects.
Behavioral Patterns – Focus on object interaction and communication.

📣 Observer – A way to notify multiple objects when something changes.
🔄 Strategy – Enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.
🚦 State – Allows an object to change behavior when its state changes.
